# Use cases

- Oceanography: speed-up of grid mesh generation from days to seconds by a code rewrite from Matlab to Python+Rust
  using a more optimal algorithm

- [SMARTool: The Strategic Mastery of Russian Tool](https://smartool.github.io/smartool-rus-eng/),
  Using GitHub Pages, JavaScript, and a CSV-based lightweight
  "database" to simplify maintenance, reuse, and contributions.

- [Constructicon: Searchable database of multiword grammatical constructions of Russian](https://constructicon.github.io/russian/).
  Moved a project from a dedicated web server and custom database to GitHub Pages, JavaScript, and a YAML-based lightweight
  "database" to simplify maintenance, reuse, and contributions.

# Our vision

## Short term

- Provide consulting
- .emph[Code review] sessions
- Work on "smaller" projects and .emph[document use cases]
- Attract more projects


## Longer term

- Be part of funding applications
- Research groups have access to best in class RSE services
- Hire more staff who collaborate on projects
- "Proper" application procedure
